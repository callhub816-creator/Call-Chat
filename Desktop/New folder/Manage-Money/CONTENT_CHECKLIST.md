## Examples: Good vs. Poor Content

### ❌ POOR Example (Do NOT publish):
"You should invest in tech stocks right now—they're guaranteed to make you rich!"

**Problems:**
- Personalized advice ("You should")
- Unrealistic promise ("guaranteed to make you rich")
- No risk disclosure
- Sounds like marketing hype

### ✅ GOOD Example:
"Some investors allocate a portion of their portfolio to growth sectors like technology. However, growth stocks carry higher volatility and risk. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Always consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions based on your personal risk tolerance and goals."

**Strengths:**
- General principle, not personalized
- Risk disclosed
- Recommends professional input
- Realistic, educational tone
